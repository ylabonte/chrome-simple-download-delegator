# Simple Download Forwarder

This Chrome Extension should be able to send (HTTP GET or POST) an url bundled with the current session context (cookies
of the active tab) and a specified download location as a json payload to a configurable endpoint.

As a follow up project there should be a simple webservice waiting for these requests to process. Processing the 
requests includes staging a request to the specified url and saving the response body to a specified download path. 

## Nothing more than a dummy extension

Until now this repo includes nothing more, than a simple extension template, with jquery and materializecss on board.
The current highlight is the icon: An incredibly ugly üí© handmade scribble drawn on my iPad üë®‚Äçüé®. 
This README will contain more information if there is more that I can you inform about.
